I reminded him that each item needed to be bought separately

"Would you be willing to buy for a little more, im worried my business will be more slow than usual today?”

“15 each then, fine with me since you have done good business with me in the past”

~ Healing = Healing - 3
~ HeroRela = HeroRela - 1
~ Gold = Gold + 45

=== DontSell1 ===
“I think I might save these for someone else who needs them more, sorry”

“I really needed those too, hopefully, we won’t get hurt by anything”

“Thanks”

“The price unfortunately just went up for that item to 50”

“Well what can you do about that, lots of people must need armor these days”

“That item is on hold for another customer at the moment, im sure you will find one on your enemies”

{
-HeroRela >= 12 : “The items you have are always a great price, I will be seeing you again soon”

~TownRela = TownRela + 3
}

{
-HeroRela == 10 : "Sad to hear that market prices are rising with demand for the items, I hope I can come again when the prices are back to normal”

~TownRela = TownRela + 1
}

{
-HeroRela <= 9 : “At least I got one of the items I came for and wasn't quick enough to get the other, you better promise to sell me the items I require next time or else”

~TownRela = TownRela - 2
}

{
-HeroRela <= 6 : “Im sorry to hear we couldn't come to an agreement over such simple items, next time I am here we will require a small chat”

~TownRela = TownRela - 4
}

{
-HeroRela <= 9 : “See you next time very, very soon”
}

{
-HeroRela > 9 : “Hope you have great business today and thanks again” 
}

I watch him and his party walk away toward another dungeon full of enemies and treasure and most likely will come back with their findings
